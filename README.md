# The Ponzu Voting Terminal: CS107e Final Project (Molly and Pun)

A fraud proof voting machine for the people. 

Problem: We need a new lecturer. We must choose between existing legend Christos Kozyrakis and supreme all-knowing overlord Matthew Trost. 

How can we privatize our votes while upholding voting standards?
How can we ensure that our singular casted vote is counted while maintaining complete anonymity to the server?

Our proposal uses Proof-of-Solvency through Merkle Trees and cryptographic hashing functions to verify a user's vote while preserving their anonymity. An accompanying voting frontend authenticates users to vote once, and only once, by their keystroke biometrics.
